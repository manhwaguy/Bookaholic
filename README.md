# Title - A Univeristy Library Management System

# Group Name - Librarian

# Author - Melwyn Cespedes

# About - A JavaFX application using a Derby SQL Database that lets "Staff" create their accounts, add/delete users/books, check in/out books. Comes with builtin admin account to remove "Staff" accounts.

# Known Bugs:
#     1. Student IDs will not display in table when user clicks "Display".
#     2. When deleting a book or user(student), program should prompt for a warning if "ID" is not          in database. Instead it prints out message saying it was.
#     3. Error in loading image, cached image for use as background in application.

# Demo User - Admin account. UN= admin, PWD = notreallysecure (FOR DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES ONLY!!!)

# Special Requirements: JavaFX 2 and Java 8, "db-derby-10.14.2.0" needs to be      installed and the jar files "derby" & "derby-client" added to the Project Library via BuildPath in Eclipse. No internet connection required to run application.

# To run application, simply download files from this REPO and add the project to your workspace in Eclipse. Remember to install "db-derby" and add the two jar files to the project Library.
